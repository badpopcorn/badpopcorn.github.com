  <h1>keep it simple, stupid</h1>
  <p>
    Albert Einstein coined a similar principle, "everything should be made
    as simple as possible, but not simpler." People tend to over analyze a
    problem when there's usually a simple and straightforward solution. Our
    web development strategy is to make things simple, but not simpler, by
    developing with three ideals: agility, scalability and speed.
