<p>A <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/twaol_expanded.html">press release</a> announced the following:</p>

<blockquote>Enabling Google Talk and AIM instant messaging users to communicate with each other, provided certain conditions are met</blockquote>

<p>A nice first step. Let's just hope that we can get AIM to use the open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP">Jabber/XMPP protocol</a> that Google uses. But I doubt that will happen anytime soon, if at all.</p>

<p>At the very least, I think I'll be able to stop using my AIM account and just use <a href="http://talk.google.com/">Google Talk</a>.</p>
