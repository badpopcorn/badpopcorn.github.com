<p>Getting service at the Apple Genius bar is gawd awfully slow even when you've made an appointment ahead of time. My cousin (Elliot) and I had spent an hour  in the Pasadena Apple Store waiting in line to get help on Camellia's iBook. (The iBook had a bad LCD). This pre-dinner stopover was not especially enjoyable on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>I am making a simple plea for those <em>"Apple Geniuses"</em> to actually use their genius brains and help customers in a timely manner.</p>
