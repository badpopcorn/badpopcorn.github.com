<p><a href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/2006/06/07/the-business-behind-google-spreadsheet/">Kevin Dangoor suggests</a> that we may eventually see Google provide an appliance for all our office needs.</p>

<p>Then I remember Cringley's <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20060105.html">article</a> suggesting a Google home entertainment appliance.</p>

<p>I would enjoy having nice simple, affordable, appliances to make my life easier. Heck, even though I love mucking with computer tech, I hate to spend all my time doing it. IT takes a lot of time to deal with, especially if one's plans involve maintaining other locations (eg other family member's homes). So if Google can come out with an appliance (all-in-one) that services all my office, entertainment and IT management needs, I would be all over it. But a message to Google: I just want something nice-- and would appeal to my geek aesthetics-- to just work, without it encumbering upon my freedoms (open integration, avoid lock-in).</p>
