<p>The Wall Street journal has an <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124269038041932531.html">interesting article</a> on yet another innovative algorithm Google is working on. Venture beat summed up the article well; "In the wake of recent brain drain, the search giant has devised an algorithm that combines employee reviews, promotion histories, pay and other factors to predict which employees are most likely to leave." Right after I read this article I found myself on the facebook "Suggestions" page, or as I like to call it, "The People I Don't Know" page. I came up with ideas and decided to post my notes.</p>

<ul>
<strong>Location</strong>
<li>Where you should live. Based on the amount of people you interact with the most and their current locations.</li>
<li>Places you should avoid. Do the exact opposite of the logic above.</li>
<li style="padding-top:5px;list-style-type:none;"><strong>Music, Television, Hobbies etc</strong> 
</li><li>Display the top among your friends, and sort by the friends you interact with the most.</li>
<li style="padding-top:5px;list-style-type:none;"><strong>Friendships</strong></li>
<li>Facebook needs to clarify why you should be friends with the people they suggest. Breaking the list into categories of; people who share the same type of information as you do, people who join and discuss the same type of topics you do, People who attend the same type of events as you do, and people that have things in common (profile details) as you do.</li>   
<li style="padding-top:5px;list-style-type:none;"><strong>Relationships (for fun)</strong></li>
<li>Your girlfriend/boyfriend will most likely break-up-with/cheat on you with "insert name here" in the next three to four weeks.</li>
<li>A "you could probably hit it" section.</li>
<li>A he's just not that into you list.</li>
<li>
  The variables I would use to figure out the feelings/attitude person A has towards person B.
<ul style="margin-top:0px;">
<li>1. The difference between the the average number of wall posts(per friend) person A has posted, and the number of wall posts person A has posted on person B's wall.</li>
<li>2. The difference between the the average time it takes person A to respond to a wall post and the average time it takes person A to post on person B's wall.</li>
<li>3. The average time person A spends on person B's profile compared to person A's average among their friends.</li>
<li>4. Use 1 and 2 but for messages instead of wall posts.</li>
<li>5. Use 1 and 2 but for photos tagged.</li>
<li>6. Use 1 and 2 but compare the results, if possible, to person's A last's relationship during the time the relationship was active.</li>
<li>7. Compare wall posts, messages, other activity of current couples, prerelationship, with the current posts, messages and other activity of person A and B.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
