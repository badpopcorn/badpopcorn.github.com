<p>My sister is off on vacation-- an outdoor-adventure trip somewhere in Central America. I must say that I am jealous of that trip because I want to do one, myself, one day. But while she's away, I am charged with doggy-sitting services for a super hyper-active cute friendly puppy beagle. Our BadPopcorn mascot, Bella:</p>

  <p>This dog is nuts. She stole my shoe and i chased her for a good 10 minutes to get it back. Hyper doesn't really describe her crazyness enough.</p>
