<p>Ok the title. I don't curse that often but feel it is a great way to do stress emphasis when needed. One of the best occasions is in a good joke. Let's not get into that. The fact is I said, "Mother fucking" to catch your attention and if you are reading this then it worked. No, don't get mad. Just continue reading.</p>

<p>So there is this slice of heaven near work called Bomba Juice. Ben, Corey and I go there often and get some of the greatest smoothies my tongue has ever been blessed to taste. Mango Strawberry or Pineapple Mango. Your imagination can run wild. Sometimes I feel like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory. Except I am a 23 old Pakistani guy and Wonka is a suspicious looking Asian kid. Seriously that guy asks to put "boba" in my drink at least 3 times.</p>

<p><strong>What makes the drink good?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>They cut up real fruit and blend it up</li>
  <li>It comes packaged nicely in a cool glass</li>
  <li>They throw in some syrup that is delicious (speaking of which i guess yahoo bought them out)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ben and I also have a nagging suspicion that there is an extra ingredient in the drinks. Usually, there is one employee at the store. However, on certain occasions I have seen an over weight Asian man in the back. He has never come out but I have always felt his presence in the store. Takes me back to Junior High and reading To Kill a Mocking Bird. This Boo Radley bitch scares me sometimes. Ben and I have agreed that he could only serve one purpose, man juice. The secret ingredient in the drinks is his man juice. I know what you are thinking.</p>

<blockquote>"Oh my god, this man has to be stopped"</blockquote>

<p>Before you jump to this conclusion. I only ask you sip the man juice first. You combine the man juice what the sweet flavor of mango and strawberry.</p>

<p>All jokes aside, the place is great and is the best smoothie I have ever had. Hands down better then Juice it Up, Baskin Robbin, and those other entire bitch as places.</p>
