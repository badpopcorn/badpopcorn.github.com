<p>Just a note to everyone: I've started a job where I'm not supposed to be Evil-- as the motto goes. Anyways, I just finished my first week of orientation up in the Bay Area and am set to head back to their satelite office in Santa Monica. I'm spending my last moments hanging with friends in San Francsisco playing foosball... Yes... Foosball. Don't laugh, I like playing this game while drinking with friends.</p>

<p>So, I won't be blogging as much about the tech I work on. I'll, instead, blog about random life stuff that doesn't conflict with NDAs.</p>

<p>Peace!</p>
