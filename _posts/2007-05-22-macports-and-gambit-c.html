<p>The <a href="http://trac.macports.org/projects/macports/ticket/11688">Gambit-C MacPorts Portfile</a> was finally committed a couple days ago, and I just got around to trying it out. Just do a `sudo port -d selfupdate`, and `port install gambit-c`. Worked like a charm! Great Job Arto! :)</p>

<p>Just a few notes about the installation for those that are trying out the examples from the Gambit-C user manual:</p>
<ul>
	<li>gsc needs "-l /opt/local/lib/gambit-c/_gambc" when generating link files.</li>
	<li>Pass the following to gcc for gambit.h: -I/opt/local/include</li>
</ul>

<p>Using an example taken from the users manual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is for example how a program with three modules (one in C and two in Scheme) can be built.  The content of the three source files (`m1.c', `m2.scm' and `m3.scm') is:</p>
</blockquote>

{% highlight c %}
/* File: "m1.c" */
int power_of_2 (int x) { return 1<<x; }
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %}
; File: "m2.scm"
(c-declare "extern int power_of_2 ();")
(define pow2 (c-lambda (int) int "power_of_2"))
(define (twice x) (cons x x))
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %}
; File: "m3.scm"
(write (map twice (map pow2 '(1 2 3 4)))) (newline)
{% endhighlight %}

<blockquote>
   <p>The compilation of the two Scheme source files can be done with three invocations of `gsc':</p>
</blockquote>

{% highlight bash %}
     $ gsc -c m2.scm        # create m2.c (note: .scm is optional)
     $ gsc -c m3.scm        # create m3.c (note: .scm is optional)
     $ gsc -link m2.c m3.c  # create the incremental link file m3_.c
{% endhighlight %}

<p>We, instead, use the following command lines:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
# optional compile into C files.
$ gsc -c m2.scm        # create m2.c (note: .scm is optional)
$ gsc -c m3.scm        # create m3.c (note: .scm is optional)
# creates the link file (m3_.c) and creates m1.c m2.c if they don't exist.
$ gsc -link -l /opt/local/lib/gambit-c/_gambc m2 m3
# Compiles the code into a.out
gcc -I/opt/local/include m1.c m2.c m3.c m3_.c -L/opt/local/lib/gambit-c -lgambc
{% endhighlight %}
