Should design and good user interface be sacrificed for optimal ad viewing? Not in my opinion. CNN, compared to other big news media, has a pretty good site design. However, their new <a href="http://newspulse.cnn.com/">pulse page</a> is ruined by horrible ad placement. In a way the design was successful, because I noticed the ad. However, I noticed it like a teenager notices a pimple on their face. I was disgusted, confused and worried it may leave a scar. I'm seeing this more and more online, and it's getting more and more annoying.  Insert <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> quotes here.
