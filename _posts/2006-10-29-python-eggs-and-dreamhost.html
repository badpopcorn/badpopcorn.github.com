<p>Dreamhost, my web host, does not yet support Python2.5, and one can't install Python <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs">eggs</a> into Dreamhost's own Python installations. The solution? I just installed a custom build of Python2.5 into my $HOME/opt directory. The following is the script I created to automate that process:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Obtain Python2.5 and unpack
mkdir $HOME/downloads/
cd $HOME/downloads/
wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5/Python-2.5.tgz
tar -zxvf Python-2.5.tgz

# Creating the location under which python (and other apps) are to be installed.
mkdir $HOME/opt

# Go into the Python2.5 directory, make && make install the thing
cd Python-2.5
./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt --enable-unicode=ucs4
make && make install

# Create a bin directory for Python, and link the bin to the real executable
mkdir -p $HOME/bin/python/bin
ln -s $HOME/opt/bin/python $HOME/bin/python/bin/python
{% endhighlight %}

<p>After the installation, I edited the bash_profile file to add the bin path:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
export PATH=$HOME/bin/python/bin:$HOME/opt/bin:$PATH
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now with a custom installation of Python, I can use eggs to manage my Django projects' library dependencies. :)</p>
