<p>Moe and I had put in applications to purchase tickets to the World Cup in Germany; of which, my results came back:</p>

<blockquote>Due to the high demand for tickets for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany (TM), the ticket applications correctly processed and accepted had to be entered into a draw. Unfortunately, you have not been allocated any tickets for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany (TM).</blockquote>

<p>The message is annoying. Was the application not selected in the draw, or was it not even in the draw? Thanks to FIFA for the informative message *sarcasm*.</p>

<p>Maybe we'll still get a couple of tickets from Moe's application.</p>
