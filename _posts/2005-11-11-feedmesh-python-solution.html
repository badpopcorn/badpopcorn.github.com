<p>Ralph Meijer's blog has a <a href="http://ralphm.net/blog/2005/10/08/twisted_sprint">nice entry</a> about connecting to the FeedMesh network, even with sample code.</p>

<p>This solution was exactly what I was looking for. The <a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted Framework</a> is used for handling both the network connection and the XML streaming (<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/xish/">Xish package</a>).</p>

<p>However, I ran into a little problem when testing the code out. I found was that the XmlStreamFactory failed to instantiate. It required another parameter in its constructor. WTF?</p>

<p>Simple reason. Ralph has been making changes to remove all the Jabber specific stuff out of Xish. That parameter was for Jabber and Ralph's changes haven't made it out into a new release.</p>

<p>So, for those that already have Xish 0.1.0 installed, here are the following code changes:</p>

{% highlight python %}
auth = xmlstream.Authenticator('')
f = xmlstream.XmlStreamFactory(auth)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Original Sample Code:</p>

{% highlight python %}
from twisted.xish import xmlstream
from twisted.internet import reactor

def onPing(element):
    print 'Ping for %s' % (element['rss'])

def connected(xs):
    print 'Connected!'
    xs.addObserver('/weblog', onPing)

f = xmlstream.XmlStreamFactory()
f.addBootstrap(xmlstream.STREAM_START_EVENT, connected)

reactor.connectTCP('sandbox.pubsub.com', 9999, f)
reactor.run()
{% endhighlight %}
