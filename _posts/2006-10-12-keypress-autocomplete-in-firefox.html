<p>If you have a javascript console open while using the firefox browser you'll notice this error from time to time.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
Error: [Exception... "'Permission denied to get property XULElement..."
{% endhighlight %}

<p>It doesn't cause any problems with the site other then the error popping up and guess what...it works fine in IE. Why? So i searched around and I think it might be an autocomplete/keypress bug in firefox. Just add the attribute "autocomplete=off" to any input that you catch keypress event on.</p>

{% highlight html %}
<input type="text" autocomplete="off" name="BadPopcornIsBetterThenYou" />
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The only reason I fixed the error was because I really like using the JavaScirpt Console in firefox. It is quite annoying when this error pops up every keypress...so like a million times. So yea, fyi for you.</p>
