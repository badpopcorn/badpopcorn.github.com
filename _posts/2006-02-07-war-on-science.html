<p>I dislike how Creationists are going about attacking Science. They're spreading propaganda about how the Big Bang is "an unproven theory"-- totally misleading. Yes there are unproven aspects of the theory, but there is a lot of evidence that proves the idea of an ever-expanding Universe that once was a small hot ball of gas; what is unproven is what exactly happened in those very early moments while it was a hot ball of gas. Those Creationists are just confusing the issue with propagandist rhetoric.</p>

<p>These Creationists are attacking the Big Bang idea because it gets in their way of their Intelligent Design. They are even portraying Intelligent Design as Science; it is not.</p>

<p>Repeat after me, "Intelligent Design is not science because you cannot apply the Scientific Method [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">1</a>] [<a href="http://www.answers.com/scientific%20method">2</a>] to this idea."</p>

<p>And related to that, you've got a very conservative administration whose lackeys are <a href="http://scientificactivist.blogspot.com/2006/01/speak-no-evil.html">censoring NASA scientific papers</a>; the censoring PR administrator <a href="http://scientificactivist.blogspot.com/2006/02/breaking-news-george-deutsch-did-not.html">didn't even graduate</a> with his claimed journalism degree.</p>

<p>Why are we allowing scientifically-untrained persons, whose political agenda may go directly against pure science, take jobs for which they are completely unqualified?</p>
