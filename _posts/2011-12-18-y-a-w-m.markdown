Yet Another Website Migration
=============================

By my count this is the sixth incarnation of the BadPopcorn website.
And it's sort of like Doctor Who, he's pretty much always The Doctor, but looks
a little different, and that how this website is today.

![Doctor Whos][2]

The Fifth Website
-----------------

The last website version had two parts to it a Wordpress blog (from the [forth
incarnation][1]) and a Rails app. There where some big plans for the Rails app,
but we got distracted with trying to get our company running and it turned
out to only generate four static pages.

Then our main project [beyond the whiteboard][3] started taking off and we
shifted from posting blogs here to [there][4]. The total number of posts
for 2010 was only three!

The Sixth Website
-----------------

A while back I read about [GitHub Pages][5] and it became clear that this
would be a good alternative to our custom Rails app. Thus this weekend I
set out to convert and transform our website yet again.

We already had a [BadPopcorn][6] organization on GitHub, so it wasn't too
difficult to start a repo under that for the website. And as a bonus I
got to learn a new tool/project named [Jekyll][7].

At first I thought that we would just replace the Rails app and leave
the Wordpress install alone, but as I learned more about [Jekyll][7] it
seemed easier to [migrate][8] the posts over as well. And that's what I did.

I had to fix up a couple of things with the posts, namely some text encodings and image locations, but overall it was pretty easy conversion.

**With the new website going hopefully we'll have a bit more posts in 2012 than 2011!**
