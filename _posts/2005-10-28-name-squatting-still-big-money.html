<p>Well, not the point of the <a href="http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/artificial-scarcity">post</a>, but here's a choice fact:</p>

<blockquote>a company called Ultsearch that made money gobbling up expired domains. Ultsearch would scan the registries for expiring domains, snatching those domains with a descent level of search engine traffic and then turning the domain into advertiser sponsored links. This garbage collection activity netted the owner a mind boggling $164.2 million when it was acquired late last year. </blockquote>

<p>Wow.</p>
