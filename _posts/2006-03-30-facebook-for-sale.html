<p>Business week recently posted an article saying that Facebook turned down a 750 million dollar offer.</p>

<blockquote>Facebook, the Web site where students around the world socialize and swap information, has put itself on the block, BusinessWeek Online has learned. The owners of the privately held company have turned down a $750 million offer and hope to fetch as much as $2 billion in a sale, senior industry executives familiar with the matter say.

<p>Is it worth 2 billion, probably not.  However, if mySpace sold for 500 then facebook should sell for atleast a billion.  Although mySpace might have more members facebook is growing  quite fast and seems to be implemented better. If you notice they tag everything in your profile, and they even tag pictures.  Their advertising business model is great too.  A person or company can submit an ad per day per school.  This lets big companies advertise or any college students that wants an ad up for a couple days at just his or her college.</p>

<p>I am happy that the facebook guys are going to get rich, because mySpace is dumb and those guys got rich.  I just hope facebook doesn't change due to a buy out by a large corporation.Â  If a company like Viacom buys them out then who knows what will happen.  Viacom already fucked me over with Chappelle show..now this!</p>
