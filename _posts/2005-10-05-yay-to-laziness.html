<p>My friends and I are lazy. And I'm one to just experiment with things. I have a generally short attention span to my "hobbies". Thus, it's been a while since I visited my badpopcorn site. Not to mention the different incarnations BadPopcorn has gone through. First, it came up as a "review" site for really bad movies. That used the Xoops CMS. Then I got rid of that. And moved to an empty page. And then to using Etomite, which sat for a while with no content. I just like playing with these different pieces of software. Now, I've settled on Wordpress.</p>

<p>We'll see how this blog goes. The intent is still generally the same. Put up stuff. maybe review. Actually work on a webcomic started by my friends. You know. the usual participation of people on the web... Web 2.0 that is...</p>
