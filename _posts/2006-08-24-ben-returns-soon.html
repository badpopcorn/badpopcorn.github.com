<p>I have previously stated that I will return to Los Angeles on September 4th, 2006.</p>

<p>That date has changed, I fly into <strong>LAX on August 28th, 2006</strong>. Just a few days left before my European Adventure 2006 has ended... I have already started planning for my next trip. :)</p>

<p>But, for now, I look forward to seeing all my friends and family in California soon.</p>
