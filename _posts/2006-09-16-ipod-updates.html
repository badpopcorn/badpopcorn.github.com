<p>With the iPod software version 1.2, I can finally set the brightness of the backlight on my iPod.  This feature was the first, ok third, thing that I tried to change after I got my ten months ago.  I have always felt that the backlight was just too bright even in various lighting conditions.  This week when I updated and found this feature it was very exciting.</p>

<p>There were two other updates that I found and made use of straight away.  First you can change the max volume output very nice for those concerned about their hearing (like me) and now when it is plugged into my computer the backlight is on (very dimly) so it is now easier to see if it has finished charging.</p>

<p>It is pretty neat how these small changes have enhanced my overall iPod experience.</p>
