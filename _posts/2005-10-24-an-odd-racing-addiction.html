<p>We have an X-Box at work. And at lunch, my coworkers and I play games. It's a rather nice luxary to have.</p>

<p>Lately, a few of us have been attempting to "Perfect" the "Burnout Revenge" game. What does this mean?</p>

<p>We acheive the "Awesome" rating and "Gold" medal (at the same time) for each map in the game.</p>

<p>I don't know why I'm talking about this, but it probably has to deal with spending two hours after work trying to "Perfect" the very last we have left to do. And I came 1 takedown away from doing it...</p>

<p>And why is this special? I hate racing games. I hate "Need for Speed". I hate the "Grand Turismo" series. But I love this game. And we've spent weeks of lunches playing the game to get where we are... so close, yet so far.</p>
