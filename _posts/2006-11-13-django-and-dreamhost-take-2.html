<p>After <a href="/blog/2006/10/29/python-eggs-and-dreamhost/">installing my own custom Python build</a>, I went back and tweaked how Django ran on my Dreamhost account. My <a href="/blog/2005/11/30/django-is-rails/">previous Django installation experience</a> is still mostly valid. I just figured I could "upgrade" the installation to take advantage of Python 2.5 and eggs.</p>

<p>I installed three eggs to get Django running</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# For Django
python ez_setup.py MySQL-python
python ez_setup.py http://www.saddi.com/software/flup/dist/flup-r2030.tar.gz
python ez_setup.py http://www.djangoproject.com/download/0.95/tarball/
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The first was mySQL support; second was for Django's built-in <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/fastcgi/">fcgi support</a>; and finally Django itself.</p>

<p>I had a second goal in this upgrade. I wanted to partition off the "/-/" subtree (For example, http://example.com/-/admin/) for Django, instead of using the full subdomain. I had to make a couple of changes to the project's urls.py file (to handle the '-') and to the .htaccess file:</p>

{% highlight python %}
# urls.py change example for the admin application.
(r'^-/admin/', include('django.contrib.admin.urls')),
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The .htaccess file:</p>
{% highlight apache %}
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^-$ /-/ [R]
RewriteRule ^-/(.*)$ /_/mysite.fcgi/-/$1 [QSA,L]
</IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And finally, a new mysite.fcgi script found in the /_/ directory (notice that it's an underscore, not a dash):</p>

{% highlight python %}
#!/home/user/bin/python/bin/python
import sys, os

# Switch to the directory of your project. (Optional.)
# os.chdir("/home/user/myproject")

# Set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable.
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = "myproject.settings"

from django.core.servers.fastcgi import runfastcgi
runfastcgi(["method=threaded", "daemonize=false"])
{% endhighlight %}
