<p>Just some cryptic notes (Post-mortem) on migrating badpopcorn.com from one web host to another web host:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wordpress Backup and Restore procedures are simple and well documented. Took 5 minutes to do.</li>
<li>Wordpress database configuration was easy to change in wp-config.php.</li>
<li>rsyncing from one host to another made the file copying easy. Complementary to my regular backup procedures.</li><li>Testing the new host was easy by changing my local /etc/hosts file to temporarily use the new host's servers.</li>
<li>I was stupid to forget to test the email forwarding before changing the name servers. Failed to catch bouncing emails.</li></ul>
