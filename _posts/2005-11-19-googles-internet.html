<p>Cringley's latest <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051117.html">post</a> about Google focuses on a mystery shipping container found in a Google garage:</p>

<blockquote>This shipping container is a prototype data center. Google hired a pair of very bright industrial designers to figure out how to cram the greatest number of CPUs, the most storage, memory and power support into a 20- or 40-foot box. We're talking about 5000 Opteron processors and 3.5 petabytes of disk storage that can be dropped-off overnight by a tractor-trailer rig. The idea is to plant one of these puppies anywhere Google owns access to fiber, basically turning the entire Internet into a giant processing and storage grid.
</blockquote>

<p>He then explores what (and how) Google might make use of this grid (World Internet Domination). I'm still digesting what he has said for my own take, but my own gut reactions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's not only a Data Center itself, but can be <b>the key future</b> building block for even larger Data Centers.</li>
<li>Google may truely bring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing">grid computing</a> capabilities to the masses, something I don't see Sun or IBM doing well.</li>
<li>This is one big fun geek toy that I want to get my hands on. :)</li>
</ul>
