<p>So im at work, you know working. I checkout a project I need to fix a bug in and make it the default web site in IIS.  I set a breakpoint and try to run the debugger.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
Error while trying to run project: unable to start debugging on the web server
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The fix wasn't too hard but it was kind of annoying.  I have two versions of .Net installed on my work computer; 2.0 and 1.1.4blah.  The default website was set as 2.0 when the project is actually 1.1.4 project.</p>

<p><strong>What to do?</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Open up ISS and and right click on the website folder that host your site, in my case it was "deafult website".</li>
	<li>Choose the ASP.Net tab.</li>
	<li>One of the options is ASP.NET version.  Change it to the correct version.</li>
	<li>Hit OK</li>
	<li>It should work now.</li>
</ol>
