<p>I would have agreed to Doc Searl's <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/02/01#pityOurPerfectWeather">statement</a> at one point:</p>

<blockquote>(Our main regional public station, <a href="http://kcrw.org/">KCRW</a> out of Santa Monica, is having an annoying fundraising marathon, which I hate. I give them money, but not during fund drives. It only encourages them.)</blockquote>

<p>I'm not so sure now. I think that the marathon is a great opportunity to raise the visibilty of the station's membership program for those that wouldn't have known otherwise; and it gives us the opportunity to support the station while getting some shwag in the process; and I'd rather have them get it all out in a week instead of hearing it year round.</p>
