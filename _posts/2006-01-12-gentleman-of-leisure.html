<p>My friends and family seem to view my latest career related move as my <em>"Retirement"</em>. I can see how my transition could be viewed in such a way, yet I will refrain from delving into examples to the contrary. I will, however, confirm the fact that I have been spending a great deal of time reading at the Bookstore, and at a local Coffee House, introduced to me by Adam and Wendy. My main driving desire is to keep my mind active, whilst I contemplate the possible long-term plans available to me; this is done by reading books, new or old (procrastinated till now):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Some random book about the Arab-Israeli conflict (Completed)</li>
	<li><em>Lolita</em> by Nabokov (Half completed)</li>
	<li><em>The Intelligent Investor</em> by Benjamin Graham (Barely Started)</li>
	<li><em>The Elements of Style</em> by Strunk & White (Barely Started)</li>
	<li><em>Rick Steves' Europe 101 (Just Purchased)</em></li>
	<li><em>Rick Steves' Best of Europe 2006 (Just Purchased)</em></li>
	<li><em>A Feast for Crows</em> by Martin (Completed)</li>
	<li><em> Fifty Degrees Below</em> by Kim Stanley Robinson (Half completed)</li>
	<li><em>Active Liberty</em> by Justice Stephen Breyer [Edit: added to list]</li>
</ul>

<p>The backyard of the coffee house is a nice English garden. It is a comfortable setting, with nooks and crannies, in which one can spend a good long time, undisturbed, reading. Although I find the beverage prices almost outrageous, I find that the environment more than makes up for this affront.</p>

<p>The front is off a major street in Fullerton, so you'll hear a lot of traffic near the front of the establishment.</p>
