<p>A great <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/mark-baker-REST">quote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Web services build upon HTTP, but they don't build upon the Web. The Web uses HTTP as an application contract which enables the loosely coupled exchange of documents between applications, while Web services uses HTTP as a bit pipe - as a transport protocol. --Mark Baker</blockquote>
