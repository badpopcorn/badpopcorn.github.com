<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_West">Adam West</a> made an appearance at E3 this year to promote the Family Guy game. We, BadPopcorn attendees, got photos taken along with signed glossies and badges.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Nathan's badge was lost/stolen on the last day somewhere by the Webzen booth. :( Anyone find it? We'd like the memorabilia back.</p>

<p>PS - Shout out to Paul of <a href="http://www.ageia.com/">Ageia</a>, who's also a big fan of Mr. West. I hope your own Nathan likes his autographed picture.</p>
