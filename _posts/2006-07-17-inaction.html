<p>Many people feel that inaction is worse then failure. I think most people don't realize just how bad or even what inaction is all together. Inaction isn't simply the lack or absence of action, but the false impression that one is <em>choosing </em>not to make a choice. Let's clear something up right away. You always make a choice.  You either choose to act in a situation or let enough time pass by where you can no longer act, but either way you do make a choice to do one or the other. So really the word has little if any real meaning. You either act in one way or you act in a different way, but you act. There is an "act of thinking", which by far is the easiest of all tasks. Thinking doesn't mean figuring something out either. It just means to look at something and say, "what the fuck." if you are in a tight spot, remember that you are making a choice.  I guarantee you choose to use the act of thinking for a while and said something along the line of "what the fuck." Basically, you still made a choice and you acted upon it.</p>

<p>So why are most people under a false impression? I thought about this for a while and came up with guilt. Yes guilt. When you convince yourself you are powerless in the outcome of a situation, you in turn rid yourself the burden of consequences or at least the guilt of those who have to face them. The fact is, life is just a choice. You choose to do something or you don't.  If you want to get in shape then you either choose to go to the gym or you don't.  If you want to know more about a topic you either choose to pick up a book or you don't.  You would think that a person who lives in the United States would be the last to use excuses, but it is the exact opposite.  We are a nation of fat, stupid. ignorant, dumb asses who have had every advantage known to man.  But it would be too much of a burden to realize the truth, so what do we do?  We pretend like it is not our fault.  We point the finger at fast food chains, tobacco companies, public eduction and etc. Stop being a fucking dumb ass. Read a book and then go run a mile.</p>

<p>Once you realize it is your fault, you also realize it is in your control.  You realize that if you worked out for 6 months then you would be in shape, that if you read a hand full of books on a topic you would dominate most people alive on the subject.  All you have to do is choose to do it, and actually believe you can.  The funny thing is, we don't. We do not choose to do it, because we don't think we can do it. I don't want to do that anymore, thats at least <em>just </em> my choice.</p>

Once you've done the mental work, there comes a point you have to throw yourself into the <strong>action </strong>and put your heart on the line. That means not only being brave, but being compassionate towards yourself, your teammates and your opponents.
