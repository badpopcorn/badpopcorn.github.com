I just recently installed <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">Ruby Enterprise Edition</a> on my Mac, but found the following errors:

{% highlight bash %}
ERROR: Error installing mysql:
ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The reason was that the Mysql files are installed under version specific directories and files when installing from Macports. For example, <code>mysql5</code> or <code>/opt/local/lib/mysql5</code>. This messes up the mysql gem installation because it looks elsewhere by default. The solution is to specify the exact mysql config location in the installation process:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
bash-3.2# /opt/ruby-enterprise-1.8.6-20090201/bin/ruby \
  /opt/ruby-enterprise-1.8.6-20090201/bin/gem install mysql \
  --  --with-mysql-config=/opt/local/bin/mysql_config5
{% endhighlight %}

<p>That last line is two dashes (-) followed by the <code>--with-mysql-config</code> option.</p>

<p>Easy as pie.</p>
