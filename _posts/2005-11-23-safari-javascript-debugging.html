<p>I really really hate Javascript. And out of all the things that I can whine on about, the fact that it's hard to debug nearly tops them all. </p>

<p>So, it makes me happy to have discovered that Safari has a hidden Javascript debug console. Just type the following in a terminal and restart Safari:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeDebugMenu 1
{% endhighlight %}

<p>(<em>I am running Safari 2.0.2 (416.12) on OS X 10.4.</em>)</p>
