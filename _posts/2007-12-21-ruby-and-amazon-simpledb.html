<p>I am a lazy person. I am also a lazy person that loves the idea of leveraging lots of computing power (as a hobby) on demand for cheap. Wow Amazon, you're really helping me out here... especially now with your <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/?node=342335011">SimpleDb</a>.</p>

<p>Of course we've all read everyone's take on the product. Why should I add to the noise... but we've got projects registered at ruby forge without any files released... dammit...</p>

<p>Show me the code!</p>

<p>Well, the NY Times peeps have <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/21/a-first-look-at-amazon-simpledb/">posted about their SimpleDb project</a>.</p>

<p>Links:</p>
<p><a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/nytimes">SimpleDb Ruby Forge Project Page</a></p>

<p><a href="http://code.nytimes.com/svn/ruby">NY Times SimpleDb SVN Repository</a></p>

<p>So will this project be the winner of the ruby bindings mind share? I think first to market gives Jacob Harris (NY Times) a very strong position in my book.</p>

<p>As for mind share... I am fond of two other rubyforge projects (above the rest) for Amazon.</p>
