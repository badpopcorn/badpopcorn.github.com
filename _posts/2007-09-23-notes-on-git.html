<p>So, it's been a while since Linus gave a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">Git talk at Google</a>. Since then, I've been playing around with it. In truth, it's still a bit rough around the edges, but it is so much smoother running than darcs.</p>

<p>Why? Because, it supports a distributed workflow such as:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create N number of branches to work off of in your local repository.</li>
	<li>Make N number of commits to those branches, only merging the polished patches into your own main line branch.</li>
	<li>The expose your own main line branch to other developers via an exposed repository on some webserver somewhere.</li>
	<li>Other developers will pull down your changes into their own repository, from which they work one the code (creating their own branches and commits).</li>
	<li>Other developers expose their own main line branches in their own public repositories, from which you can pull down their changes.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, here are my notes about getting setting up one's own Git repositories. Note that you will generally have at least two repositories: Personal development one, and one exposed for your own published commits. In Git, the public directory is generally a "bare" repository sans a working directory. Whereas your private repository has a working directory... for your work.</p>

<p>Here are steps (rough notes) for creating the public and private repository for a project:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# -- Create your area to store the public repositories
mkdir -p ~/repo

# -- CREATE THE PROJECT
mkdir -p ~/projects/myprojectname
cd ~/projects/myprojectname
git init-db

# -- Commit something first, like a README.txt
touch README.txt
git add README.txt
git commit -a

# -- CREATE PROJECT'S PUBLIC REPOSITORY
# NOTE: Git bombs out if there are Zero commits in the project you are
#   making public. Make sure there's at least one commit in that repository.
#   The reason I committed an empty README.txt. But also, one could have
#   created a bare Git repository without the clone.
cd ~/repo/

# copy the repository in bare form-- sans working directory.
git clone --bare ~/projects/myprojectname myprojectname.git

# make the repository available for reading.
touch myprojectname.git/git-daemon-export-ok
cd myprojectname.git

# update the server info for remote clients, tracking branches.
git --bare update-server-info

# post-update executes everytime there is a push to this public repository;
# it executes an update-server-info by default.
chmod a+x hooks/post-update

# -- MAKE THE REPOSITORIES VISIBLE
# NOTE: Put it on a dumb (read only) webserver of your choice.
#   I rsync it to my dreamhost account; this command is a cron job.
# The following makes the assumption that the public_html directory
# is the web root for the exposed ~username/ directory for the
# webhost.example.com webhost.
cd ~
rsync -av -e ssh ~/repo username@webhost.example.com:public_html/

# -- UPDATE THE PUBLIC REPOSITORY
# NOTE: This updates your local copy of the project's public repository;
#   where the next run of the rsync cron job will update the public
#   webserver.
cd ~/projects/myprojectname
git push ~/repo/myprojectname.git master:master

# -- OTHERS DEVELOPERS CLONE PROJECT'S EXPOSED REPOSITORY
# NOTE: On another machine, another developer.
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
git clone http://webhost.example.com/~username/repo/myprojectname.git

# This developer now has his own copy at ~/projects/myprojectname;
# this developer will then work and create patches to send to you.
# If you have pushed updates to your public repository, this other
# developer may pull down your changes using:
git pull
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now, only if I could better figure out how I'd like to work on managing my own branches, and tracking remote branches.</p>
