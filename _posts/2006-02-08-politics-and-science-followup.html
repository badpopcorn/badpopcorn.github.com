<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/politics/08nasa.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">NYTimes article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>George C. Deutsch, the young presidential appointee at NASA who told public affairs workers to limit reporters' access to a top climate scientist and told a Web designer to add the word "theory" at every mention of the Big Bang, resigned yesterday, agency officials said.</blockquote>

<p>Good riddance, but it's only a small victory against those Intelligent Design propagandists; and it won't be a lasting one unless NASA can get its review policy straightened out.</p>

<p>PS- The NY Times article also confirms this appointee's lack of a degree in case you didn't think that my <a href="/blog/2006/02/07/war-on-science/">prior post</a>'s source was good enough.</p.

<blockquote>Mr. Deutsch's resignation came on the same day that officials at Texas A&amp;M University confirmed that he did not graduate from there, as his resume on file at the agency asserted.</blockquote>
