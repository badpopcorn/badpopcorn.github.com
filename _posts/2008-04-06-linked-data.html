<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">Linked Data</a> has been defined for almost two years now:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Use URIs as names for things</li>
	<li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.</li>
	<li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information.</li>
	<li>Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.</li>
</ol>

<p>But I think it's just only now that people are starting to do it... about time.</p>
