<p>Anyone want to meet up to go see <a href="http://300themovie.warnerbros.com/">"<strong>300</strong>" </a>on Firday?</p>

<p>That's really all I got</p>

<p>I'm indescribably psyched for the movie.</p>

<p>Ben, Corey...I can already see you smiling and nodding...through the internets I see it. (What the Fuck am I? Yoda?! Mmm through the internets I see it yeeesss Rock Ass it will!)</p>

<p>I am thinking of seeing it in the O.C. of course...I would be willing to brave the spectrum for this but as I said I am super-excited.</p>

<p>Who's in?</p>
