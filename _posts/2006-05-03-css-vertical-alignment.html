<p>I just came across something kind of dumb. If you are using a CSS stylesheet and want to change the valign of a data table you have to use "vertical-alignment" instead of "valign". Even though valign is the correct syntax for html.</p>

{% highlight css %}
td {
  vertical-align: top;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Im sure most people might know this, but I didn't and it confused me for a good 5 minutes.</p>
