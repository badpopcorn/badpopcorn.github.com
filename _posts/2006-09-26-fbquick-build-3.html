<p>We just put up Build 3 of <a href="http://www.fbquick.com/">fbQuick</a>-- the best Facebook Notifier application-- on our website.</p>

<p>It has a new feature that gives you the ability to startup in offline-mode; and to go into offline-mode when we detect two consecutive failures in connecting to Facebook's web interface. fbQuick will stay in offline-mode until you decide to connect (double-click the tray icon, or right-click menu option) back to Facebook, all very straight forward and simple.</p>

<p>This release also fixes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bug in comparing old wall counts with new wall counts.</li>
	<li>Better error messages.</li>
	<li>Misc internal code cleanup.</li>
</ul>

<p>New release at <a href="http://www.fbquick.com/">fbQuick.com</a>.</p>
