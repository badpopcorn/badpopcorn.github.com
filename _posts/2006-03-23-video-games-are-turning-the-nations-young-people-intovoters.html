<p>Of course, when speaking of Political matters, "Young People" can range anywhere from 18 to 40, but that doesn't mean that the lawmakers are out of touch...does it?</p>

<p><a title="Theesa, sounds like a Conan villain" href="http://www.theesa.com/" target="_blank">The Entertainment Software Association</a>, has created the <a title="They could use a cooler acronym" href="http://www.videogamevoters.org/">Video Game Voters Network</a>. The point of the V.G.V.N. is, of course to inspire legislators to think twice before backing legislation that has-at least so far-been <strong>unfailingly stricken down as unconstitutional</strong>. The plan is that the threat of gamers that are mobilized, motivated, and prepared to vote in defense of their past-time will convince legislators that the <strong>easy "Family Values" votes</strong> they get for being Anti-Gamers Rights, might not seem so easy when they realize that Gamers Rights might actually be some of the values of the modern family.</p>

<p>In my opinion it is a beautiful dream. That's whay I'm linking, to do my part. If you enjoy video games...or <a title="Click it" href="http://www.billofrights.org/">your first amendment rights</a> it might be worth heading over and signing up.</p>

<p>Sorry for getting up on that Soap Box like that but sometimes the only way to keep from being stepped on, is to stand up.</p>

<p>Did you know that the Government does not regulate access to or the sale of movies, books or cable TV?</p>

<p>Neither did I. Apparently those systems are totally voluntary too...must be due to that pesky Constitution.</p>
