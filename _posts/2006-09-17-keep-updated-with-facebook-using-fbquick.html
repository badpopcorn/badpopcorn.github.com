<p>Moe came up with the <a href="http://www.fbquick.com/">fbQuick</a> idea while I was still in Europe, a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> Notifier...</p>

<p>"A what?", I asked.</p>

<p>"<em>Like the <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/notifier/notifier_windows.html">GMail notifier</a>, but for Facebook.</em>"</p>

<p>"I'm still not following."</p>

<p>"<em>You know Facebook? It's like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a>, but for colleges... It's gonna be a little application that sits in your desktop's system tray-- like AIM, or Skype-- and regularly checks Facebook for new messages, wall posts, comments, and stuff! When you get a new message, a little alert is displayed in the bottom corner of your screen.</em>"</p>

<p>"And stuff? You sound excited."</p>

<p>"<em>Dude, it's gonna be tight!</em>"</p>

<p>"Ok, let's do it."</p>

<p>Sure enough Moe came over the morning after I returned from Europe. A few weeks worth of work with Corey, and we now have its public launch at:</p>
