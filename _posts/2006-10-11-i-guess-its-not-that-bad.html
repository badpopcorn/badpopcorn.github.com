<p>Over the years, I had developed an absolute hatred in my heart when it came to Javascript and DOM programming. No one big specific reason, just all the little annoyances: browser incompatibilities, debugging sucked (was tedious), never found any javascript library helpful or easy to use (this includes prototype, MochiKit, and Dojo), etc. Let's just say that I would have rather gotten teeth pulled using rusty pliers.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong> I've come to rethink my position... I can now stand, even <em>enjoy</em>, Javascript programming. Wow, what could have possibly happened to me (a once huge Javascript hater) to actually like it now? I give you the three reasons why:</p>

<ol>
	<li>I started to work the Javascript language as it were actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_programming_language">Scheme</a> (or similar functional language), closures and all.</li>
	<li>I found the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/">Firebug</a> debugging plugin for Firefox. I will never have to use an alert() call ever again :).</li>
	<li>And the <strong>biggest reason</strong> why I changed my mind: I found <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. This libary removed all the little pains I listed above, and released me in a way that I could focus on doing #1 above.</li>
</ol>

<p>Take those three, and mix it up with with a <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> powered backend... I am thoroughly confident that Javascript does not suck.</p>
