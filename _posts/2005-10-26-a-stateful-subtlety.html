<p>A <a href="http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/stateful-web-services">post</a> over at the counterpoint blog brings up Stateful Web Services.</p>

<p>After reading it over a few times, I believe the post asserts that:</p>
<ol>
<li>SOA and Web Services lend themselves towards a course-grained API. (Which I think it means WS-*).</li>
<li>But user interactions require repetitive low-latency fine-grained interactions.
<i>I believe that the post suggests that the client will interact over the network to a server (Web Service) with a fine-grained API(maybe a proxy that sits in front of a course-grained Web Service).</i></li>
<li>And finally its example of, the "Attaching documents to a webmail requires a temporary creation of a resource on the server." that can be used to achieve fine-grained access. This is used to claim: "statefulness is a necessary evil, but it is mitigated by the service providing a fool-proof interaction sequence."</li>
</ol>

<p>I am not opposed to the creation of temporary resources, nor do I have a position on fine-grained vs course-grained.</p>

<p>But, let me suggest that <b>state</b> isn't something that needs to be stored and managed by the service. Rather, state is just a snapshot of the resources found on the server. A very subtle distinction. And yes, I am suggesting REST.</p>
