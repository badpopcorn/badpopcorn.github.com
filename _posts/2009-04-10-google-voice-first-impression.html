<p>Our Grand Central account magically turned into our Google Voice account the other day, and I couldn't be more pleased. Google took the robust look of Grand Central and made it look as simple as Gmail. I can easily browse call history, send a <a href="http://www.google.com/support/voice/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=117108">sms</a> or update our voicemail. I'm really excited to see how well the voicemail transcript will work also, and if it will be offered with <a href="http://www.google.com/support/voice/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=115037">recorded calls</a>. The most popular feature might just end up being the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/voice/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=115128">call widget</a>; <em>"You can allow others to call you from your website or blog by adding a call widget to it. Visitors to the website can click the widget, enter their phone number, and Google Voice will call them and connect the call to your Google number." </em></p>

<p>You can also call out of the country with competitive VOIP rates. Wait a minute...Google might generate a large revenue source other then ads!?</p>
