<p>Arg! You would think Google would do uploads correctly, but it turns out that we would sometimes get a bad download from the Google Page Creator hosted file. And that's what happened with the exe downloads from this weekend!</p>

<p>So people that downloaded fbQuick from sometime last weekend until this morning had an installer that would fail. I fixed all that now, so please <a href="http://fbquick.com/">redownload</a> if it was you. Sorry about that. :(  Correct MD5 for the current version i 233fa9acd3aa3c6adbe51e0ea30b2e5d.</p>

<p>(If you want to verify the md5 sum, then try one of these windows utilities: </p>

<p>Thank you to the person that reported this issue. :)</p>

<p>I think the logs say that there were 100 downloads this weekend, and I completely appologize to every one that was affected.</p>
