<p>I had high hopes for China for a few brief days in 1989. The Berlin wall had just collapsed and it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989">looked like</a> the PRC was about to go the same way. But the central government decided to send in troops to crack down on the protests. And from that, the world saw an incredible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tianasquare.jpg">act of defiance</a> (he stood there for half and hour), which summed every demonstrator's hope for a reformed China. Who was he? I don't know, but maybe I'll find out after watching Frontline:</p>

<blockquote>On June 5, 1989, one day after Chinese troops expelled thousands of demonstrators from Tiananmen Square in Beijing, a solitary, unarmed protester stood his ground before a column of tanks advancing down the Avenue of Eternal Peace. Captured by Western photographers watching nearby, this extraordinary confrontation became an icon of the fight for freedom around the world. On April 11, veteran filmmaker Antony Thomas investigates the mystery of the tank man -- his identity, his fate, and his significance for the Chinese leadership.</blockquote>
