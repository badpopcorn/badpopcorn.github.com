<p>One of the older BadPopcorn posts has started getting comment spam, so I decided to check out what spam protection I could install with <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> (software that runs the site). I installed the <a href="http://www.akismet.com">Akismet</a> plugin. It's already caught a few more spams, but let one pass. It's better than nothing, but it will take time to see if it really works.</p>

<p>A side note: I had to create another username/password pair to use Akismet, aarrg.</p>
