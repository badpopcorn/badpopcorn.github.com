<p>Van Jacobson has, in his <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6972678839686672840">Google TechTalk</a>, many good quotes... my two favorite:</p>

<blockquote>"Data's got a name, not a location." -- Van Jacobson</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Data doesn't live anywhere; where ever it is, it's great." -- Van Jacobson</blockquote>
