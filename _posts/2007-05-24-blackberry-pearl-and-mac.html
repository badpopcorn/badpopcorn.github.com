<p>It's called tethering, and the two websites you should look at:</p>
<ol>
	<li>http://www.taniwha.org.uk/</li>
	<li>http://www.fibble.org/archives/000508.html</li>
</ol>

<p>The BlackBerry Modem Scripts found on both sites are essentially the same (diff). I won't bore you with the details, but just follow those instructions... and you'll like getting internet wherever you go. I just have two things to iron out: I get disconnected after a few minutes of inactivity, and I get a "Bluetooth Model Resource Busy" error after I've uploaded pictures from my phone to the Mac. For the former, I just reconnect; To get around latter, I have to go through the stupid process of repairing my device and setting it all up again. :(</p>

<p>In fact, I wrote this post over the thether. :)</p>
