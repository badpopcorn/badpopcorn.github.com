    At BadPopcorn, we only work on projects we believe in. We feel that being
    passionate about a project is key in building great websites. Over the
    past three years we have become passionate about
    <a href="http://www.crossfit.com">CrossFit</a>. We built
    <a href="http://beyondthewhiteboard.com">beyond the whiteboard</a> to help
    CrossFit Affiliates organize, analyze and grow their CrossFit gym.

    This idea is not our business strategy. It's our philosophy. We are going
    to make products that offer benefits. Products that make life simpler and
    more efficient. Sadly, this makes us unique.
